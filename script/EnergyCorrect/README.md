# Files in this folder is used to calculate energy correction.

1. First use PositionEvolution.py and search.py to collect dislocation position during neb path. (You should use the scripts in disregistry folder to determine the disregistry and dislocation position.)

2. Second use EnerpyPosition.py plot energy in reaction coordinate and with babel, linear, quadratic correction. (For babel correction, you should use babel to calculate elastic interaction.)
