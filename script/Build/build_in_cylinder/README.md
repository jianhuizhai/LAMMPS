# The files in this folder are used to automatically selected atoms in the cylinder

* generate_deleted.py is used to genrate deleted.dat which contains the atoms info those already deleted (do not contain the distributional atom which is used to determine which atom is more favorable to delete).

* build_in_cylinder.py is combined with generate_deleted.py to select the ions in the cylinder (you should run generate_deleted.py first) .
